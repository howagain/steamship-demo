# Multi-modal Agent Starter

This repository hosts example AI Agents that you can deploy and use on [Steamship](https://steamship.com) in seconds.

Each sub-folder contains a fully-working example:

* `ai-character-with-stable-diffusion` - A character whose personality you can customize. Can generate Stable Diffusion images and send them back to the user.
* `ai-character-with-voice` - A character you can customize and deploy. Responds to the user with a generated voice instead of text.
* `question-answering-bot` - A QA Bot that can learn PDFs, YouTube transcripts, and text and then answer questions about them.

## Developer Instructions

1. **Pick a starter project** among the folders here. Copy and rename that folder so that it becomes your own.
2. **Follow the README.md** instructions inside your new project
