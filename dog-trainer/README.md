# AI Dog Trainer

This Agent is intended to be used in conjunction with the companion [Vercel Example here](https://github.com/steamship-core/steamship-frontend/tree/main/examples/with-nextjs-auth-and-database).

It implements a very basic exploration of the following ideas:

* Offering an API Method (`/set_prompt_arguments`) that lets a web app set a list of **DOGS** that are being cared for, as well as their breeds.
* Engages in conversations about dog care in general
* Permits the user to discuss their dogs (set via `set_prompt_arguments`) by name, specifically:
  * Asking questions ("How much should Barky eat?".. "What about Fido?")
  * Generating simulated images ("Show me a picture of Rocky swimming in the river")

In the case of specific questions about the dog, the agent will use a series of prompt rewriting tricks to de-reference the dog name or pronoun into
a prompt that is specific to the particular breed and description of dog that the agent has learned.

## Getting Started

You can be up and running in under a minute. [A full setup walk-through is here](https://steamship.com/learn/agent-guidebook/project-setup).

Clone this repository, then set up a Python virtual environment with:

```bash
python3.8 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python3.8 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python3.8 -m pip install -r requirements.dev.txt
```

> [!NOTE]
> Requirements you put in `requirements.txt` are what will be run along with the agent when you deploy. The dependencies
> in `requirements.dev.txt` have been prepopulated with packages you may need while developing on your machine.

## Running your agent

[A full guide to running is here](https://docs.steamship.com/agent-guidebook/getting-started/run-your-agent).

With the proper Python environment set up and your `STEAMSHIP_API_KEY` environment variable set, just run:

```bash
ship run local
```

Note that this Agent will actively refuse to respond until you have invoked the `/set_prompt_arguments` to tell it about some Dogs üêï.

## Modifying your agent

Modify your agent by editing `api.py`. 

You can:

- Change its personality (edit the SYSTEM_PROMPT)
- Add tools, allowing your agent's reasoning process to do new things (see tool list below)
- Add mixins, allowing your agent to connect to different channels (see mixin list below)

Other examples are found in the `example_agents` folder. Copy/paste one of these into `api.py` to use it.

## Deploying your agent

[A full guide to deploying is here](https://docs.steamship.com/agent-guidebook/getting-started/deploy-your-agent).

This project can be deployed straight to the cloud. Simply type:

```bash
ship deploy
```

and follow the prompts.

## Connecting your agent to the web

This Agent is intended to be used in conjunction with the companion [Vercel Example here](https://github.com/steamship-core/steamship-frontend/tree/main/examples/with-nextjs-auth-and-database).
Just follow the directions on that README and then set the `STEAMSHIP_PACKAGE_HANDLE` environment variable to the value of your version of this agent rather than the `ai-dog-trainer` value provided in that example.

## What other tools can I use with my agent?

Tools help your agent perform actions or fetch information from the outside world. 
The Steamship SDK includes [a large set of multi-modal & memory-aware tools you can use right away](https://docs.steamship.com/agent-guidebook/core-concepts/tools).
And you can import or find more open source tools in the [Steamship SDK](https://github.com/steamship-core/python-client):

## What other mixins can I use with my agent?

Mixins provide additional API endpoints to your agent, which can connect your agent to a communication channel like Telegram, or provide additional data loading functionality.

Several mixins are provided out of the box in the Steamship SDK:

* Transports (Communication Channels)
  * [Steamship Web Widget](https://github.com/steamship-core/python-client/blob/main/src/steamship/agents/mixins/transports/steamship_widget.py) - For testing your agent in the Web UI
  * [Telegram](https://github.com/steamship-core/python-client/blob/main/src/steamship/agents/mixins/transports/telegram.py) - for communicating with your agent in Telegram
  * [Slack](https://github.com/steamship-core/python-client/blob/main/src/steamship/agents/mixins/transports/slack.py) - for communicating with your agent in Slack
* Data Loading
  * [Indexer Pipeline](https://github.com/steamship-core/python-client/blob/main/src/steamship/invocable/mixins/indexer_pipeline_mixin.py) - For loading documents into your agent's question-answer ability
